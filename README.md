## features

it simply sends the full quality image of the pixiv link. because pixiv original embeds only send half of the image, as well as because their image cdn forbids people from sending the raw image link, i made this bot lol.

this utilizes my pixiv mirror (created using cloudflare workers), https://pximg.jackli.dev/, and [hibiapi](https://github.com/mixmoe/HibiAPI)

theres no commands, just send a pixiv link and it will automatically send the full image.
